                    My name is Jiahui, but I go by Jeff. I am a Junior studying 
                    computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. I am from New York City,
                    but was born in China. I started off as a Biomedical Engineer, but thought
                    that it was too all over the place. Biomedical Engineers incorporated little
                    bit of everything such as bio, chem, mechanical engineering, computer science
                    and more. I wanted to sit down and focus on one. I found coding to be more fun
                    and satisfying than making models in SolidWorks then printing them out using a 
                    3D printer.

                    Here is a fun, but mostly controversial fact about me. Wawa is a popular 
                    chain convenience store/gas station in Philadelphia. Throughout my years at UPenn,
                    I have yet to purchase anything from Wawa. Shocker. In my free time, I collect
                    sneakers, code, and develop <i>quirky</i> skills such as card magic and solving rubik's cube.
                    By no means am I good, but I get by enough to make people go <b>woah</b>.
